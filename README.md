🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed historical video game sales data to identify patterns that determine a game’s commercial success. Acting as a data analyst for an online video game retailer, the goal was to generate insights that could support advertising strategy and product planning for the upcoming year (2017).

The analysis focused on how platforms, genres, user and critic reviews, age ratings, and regional differences impact sales performance across North America, Europe, and Japan.

🔍 Key Tasks & Methods

Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales and review data

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Analyzed platform life cycles and generational shifts

Compared regional preferences and genre performance

Conducted statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate revenue differences between user groups and regions

📊 Key Insights

Games available on multiple platforms significantly outperform platform-exclusive titles

User and critic ratings strongly correlate with higher sales over time

Games rated E (Everyone) and T (Teen) show consistently stronger global performance

Newer platforms drive growth while older platforms decline, highlighting clear product life cycles

🎯 Business Impact

Based on the analysis, the recommended strategy is to:

Prioritize multi-platform game releases

Focus marketing efforts on highly rated titles

Invest in newer platforms with growing user bases

Target globally appealing age ratings for maximum reach
